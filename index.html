    <h1>Ujjal Sharma</h1>
    
    <p>I work as a Software Developer at Nutanix, but I'm deeply passionate about AI and the Age of Intelligence. I believe AI, like any technology, will enhance our productivity, ability, and consciousness. I spend most of my time trying to contribute to this vision through my projects and work.</p>
    
    <p>I studied Computer Science and Economics at BITS Goa. I love physics and high concept sci-fi stuff. Obsessed with consciousness (we should upload ourselves, haha), time (can we reverse entropy), and building my own iron man suit of course.</p>
    
    <p>I'm building <a href="https://ujjalsharma100.github.io/curio_landing_page/">Curio</a> because I believe deep personalization is key to building great AI products. The best AI systems learn about you over time, understand your unique needs and preferences, and adapt to serve you on a deeply personal level. This is what I'm working towards.</p>

    <h2>Other stuff</h2>
    <p><a href="https://ujjalsharma100.github.io/talkdb-landing-page/">talkdb</a> - I believe talking with data should be done in natural language. Data is key to business, and communicating with it and generating insights from it should be done in natural language, which AI enables.</p>
